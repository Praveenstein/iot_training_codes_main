## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

        pip install -r requirements.txt
        

## Usage
The project contains code samples for each of the following protocols:
- TCP
- HTTPS
- MQTT
- OPC UA

You can run each of these samples individually to gain an understanding of how they work.

To run a sample, navigate to the appropriate directory and run the scripts
